## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This project is to set up a NFT minting and staking site for a book on emerging technology, whereby 50% of the author royalties and 50% of the NFTbook sales revenues (after 15% provided to the publisher) are allocated to the staked NFTs.   

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
Bridgit DAO is authoring a book called “The Metaweb: The Next Level of the Internet”. The book is about a new layer on top of the web that creates decentralized public space above the web page, which will drastically reduce the problems with false information, abusers, and scammers, as well as enable an unprecedented level of connection and coordination that is necessary to deal with our existential threats.

Our publisher is the renowned Taylor & Francis. This will be both a physical book and a NFTbook. This will be Taylor & Francis' first NFTbook. 

We will start out with a generative Pre-sale NFT series 

In addition to

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
We will use Mintbase code APIs to develop a website that supports the minting and staking of NEAR NFTs. These NFTs can also be listed on our Mintbase store for secondary sale. 
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
We want to use NFTs to accelerate the adoption of the technology explored in the book and to increase the sales and distribution of the book and the NFTbook. We think NFT staking has huge potential especially when connected to real world revenue streams. We are also excited about the possibility of  helping Taylor & Francis do NFTbooks for other books in their catalog.  

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our target audience is readers of high technology books, Web3 fans, developers, entreprenuers, and marketers.  
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Our project provides a way for people can participate in the Next Level of the Web as a funder and thereby recieve an allocation of the royalties from the sales of the book and the NFTbook. The funds raised will go to the expenses associated with the production, marketing, and distribution of the book and the NFTbook.   
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
Yes. 

  - If so, how is your project different?
There are two NFTbook prjects on NEAR but they do not use NFTs as a crowdpooling vehicle for NFTbooks

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  3 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 50,000 USD

### Milestone 1 — Implement Mintbase Modules for Generative NFT Mint with scheduled Airdrop of NFTbook utility

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 15,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Mintbase nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Mintbase module: Generative Mint | We will create a Mintbase / NEAR module that will randomly select a unique jpg or gif and mint a pre-sale NFT to a specific user wallet upon transfer of mint and gas fees  |  
| 2. | Mintbase module: Airdrop | We will create a Mintbase / NEAR module that will airdrop a NFTbook to holders of the pre-sale NFT upon demand |  

### Milestone 2 — Implement Mintbase Modules for Staking NFT and Paying Royalties to NFT Holders

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 15,000 USD

| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | Mintbase module: Stake | We will create a Mintbase / NEAR module that will enable holders to stake their pre-sale NFT and NFTbook |  
| 2. | Mintbase module: Pay Royalties | We will create a Mintbase / NEAR module that will pay royalties on demand by admin to stakers based on the relative time staked and the staking power of their staked pre-sale NFT and/or NFTbook |  
| 3. | NEAR chain integration | Modules Generative Mint, Airdrop, Stake, Pay Royalties, Public Webpage, and Admin Webpage of our custom chain will interact in such a way that the user mint a Pre-release NFT, the admin can airdrop the official NFTbook when the book is released, the pre-sale NFT holder can stake their pre-sale NFTs and/or NFTbooks, and the admin can trigger royalty payments as appropriate. |
